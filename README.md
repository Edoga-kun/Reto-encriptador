🚀 Hello community! 🚀

I want to share with you a new project I’ve been working on as part of the #ChallengeProgramming by #AluraLatam in collaboration with #Oracle.

I’ve created a Text Encryptor using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 💻🔐 This project has allowed me to dive deeper into frontend development and data encryption logic, all from the client side.

🔑 Key Features:

Text Encryption and Decryption: Protect your messages with a simple yet effective encryption algorithm.
Intuitive Design: The interface is designed to be user-friendly, clean, and functional.
100% JavaScript: The logic runs in the browser, without relying on external servers.
💡 This project has been an exciting and rewarding challenge! If you’re interested in learning more or collaborating, I invite you to check out the repository on GitHub.

I thank #AluraLatam and #Oracle for this opportunity for learning and growth. 🚀✨
